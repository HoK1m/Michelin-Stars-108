    "The ideal dataset for our question would be of the Michelin starred restaurants throughout the years.  The observations would be each Michelin starred restaurant, and the amount of observations would be the total amount of all those restaurants. The ideal variables for each observation would be the name of the restaurant, how many stars they earned per year, the location/region they are located in. We would also need another dataset of the tire sales for each year. Here the observations would be each year, and the more observations there are would be more helpful. The variables of the observation would be the tire manufacture and the amount of tires sold or the amount of revenue generated for the year (tire revenue). These two datasets are hopefully collected by Michelin for the starred restaurants and the tire manufacturers for the tire sale history. Ideally the data would be stored in a csv file which we can then bring into pandas. If not, we might need to find some ways to scrape the data we need from various sites. \n",
