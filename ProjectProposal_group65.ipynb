    "When the Michelin Guide was started, its original goal was to promote travel, which in turn would theoretically increase tire sales as more people drove to visit the locations in the guide. By 1920, the guide itself cost 7 francs, and in 1936 the criteria for star rankings was published (Source 1). Over time, the idea of particular restaurants being worth traveling to has turned the Michelin star into the symbol of prestige as we know it today. As of March 2020, Japan hosts the most Michelin-starred restaurants, with France coming in a close second (Source 2). However, while Michelin stars are awarded worldwide, the official guides are broken down by region -- in some cases each country is a region, but in places like China and the US, regions are broken down by city (Source 2). \n",
    "\n",
    "Within the tire industry, as of 2018, Michelin comes in second to Bridgestone, which is based in Tokyo, Japan. Goodyear comes in third, with Germany's Continental A.G. and Japan's Sumitomo Rubber Industries following in 4th and 5th place, respectively (Source 3, 4). For the majority of these companies, tire sales is their main form of revenue. Continental A.G. is the only exception out of the top five, making only about a quarter of its revenue from tire sales (Source 3, 4). Changes in market pressures and costs have pushed consumers towards more electric vehicles, increasing overall vehicle demand, which in turn increases tire demand. Competition among tire manufacturers are also pushing them to expand into various countries such as Pakistan (Source 5). With these factors in mind, we hope to better be able to determine the influence, if any, that the Michelin Guide has on the tire market.\n",

   "source": [
    "We hypothesize that there will be a small correlation between the number of restaurants awarded Michelin stars, and the number of tire sales per year. We also believe that the location of the Michelin restaurants does matter. This is based on the idea that people do have to travel to different locations to be able to go to the restaurants and this causes tires to wear down. Location is also important because some cities/countries rely more on public transportation and therefore use less tires than places that travel mostly by car."

    "The ideal dataset for our question would be of the Michelin starred restaurants throughout the years.  The observations would be each Michelin starred restaurant, and the amount of observations would be the total amount of all those restaurants. The ideal variables for each observation would be the name of the restaurant, how many stars they earned per year, the location/region they are located in. We would also need another dataset of the tire sales for each year. Here the observations would be each year, and the more observations there are would be more helpful. The variables of the observation would be the tire manufacture and the amount of tires sold or the amount of revenue generated for the year (tire revenue). These two datasets are hopefully collected by Michelin for the starred restaurants and the tire manufacturers for the tire sale history. Ideally the data would be stored in a csv file which we can then bring into pandas. If not, we might need to find some ways to scrape the data we need from various sites. \n",
